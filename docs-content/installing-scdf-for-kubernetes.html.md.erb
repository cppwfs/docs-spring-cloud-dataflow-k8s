This topic describes how to install Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes.

Before proceeding, review the [Configuring Installation Values](configuring-installation-values.html) topic to ensure that you have configured all of the required or recommended installation resources.

## <a id='install-scdf-create-imagpe-pull-secret'></a> Creating an Image Pull Secret for Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes

Before installing Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes, you must create a Kubernetes secret that lets the Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes service accounts pull images from the Tanzu Network Registry or from the registry where you optionally have relocated the images.
In the namespace where you intend to install, create a secret, as shown in the next example.

First, set the username and password variables based on your Tanzu Network login credentials or to the credentials for the registry where you have optionally relocated the images.

```bash
registry=registry.pivotal.io
username=<your user name>
password=<your password>
```

Then create the secret using the values you set in the preceding example:

```bash
kubectl create secret \
docker-registry scdf-image-regcred \
--docker-server=${registry} \
--docker-username=${username} \
--docker-password=${password}
```

## <a id='install-scdf-for-k8s-dev'></a> Installing Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes to the dev environment

The install script located in `bin/install-dev.sh` automates the following steps of installing into an existing Kubernetes cluster.

* PostgreSQL
* RabbitMQ
* Skipper Server
* Data Flow server

If you want to use an Ingress resource, run the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl kustomize ./apps/ingress/kustomize/overlays/production/ | kapp deploy -y -a ingress -f -
```

To uninstall, run the `bin/uninstall-dev.sh` script.

To uninstall the Ingress, run the following command:

```bash
kapp delete -y -a ingress
```

## <a id='install-scdf-for-k8s-prod'></a> Installing Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes to the production environment

Before running the following command ensure, that the database that Skipper and Data Flow need to use has been provisioned and properly configured in each `application.yaml` configuration file.

To install `skipper` app, run the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl kustomize ./apps/skipper/kustomize/overlays/production/ | kapp deploy -y -a skipper -f -
```

To install `data-flow` app, run the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl kustomize ./apps/data-flow/kustomize/overlays/production/ | kapp deploy -y -a data-flow -f -
```

If you want to use an Ingress resource, run the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl kustomize ./apps/ingress/kustomize/overlays/production/ | kapp deploy -y -a ingress -f -
```

Alternatively, instead of piping the output of `kubectl kustomize` to kapp, you can pipe it to a file and then manage that file in a manner that fits into existing company deployment procedures for Kubernetes applications.
